A collection of database queries in SPARQL, SQL and dialects to retrieve data from sources such as Google BigQuery, StackOverflow, DBpedia and wikidata.

You can see the application of these queries and how to process and visualize the resulting data in different [Jupyter notebooks](http://ramiro.org/notebooks/) and tools like the [Reddit Post Times Explorer](http://ramiro.org/tools/reddit-post-times/).
